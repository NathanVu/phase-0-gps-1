#Reflection 
- I was struggling with the concept of working from a cloud, i.e. github and what it meant to push and pull form a cloud based system.
- The way conflicts are resolved was clarified greatly.
- We asked for specific commands that we couldn't remember, or didn't quite grasp.
- Everything we have covered so far I feel as though I have a decent uderstanding of it. the biggest problem i have is remembering to type out full git commands. 
- I didn't think that it would be so time consuming, but I still feel like I got way more out of it than the solo study sessions.
