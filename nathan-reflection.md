Reflection for Nathan 

-I had trouble with understanding the Fetch, and Merge conflict concept. After working with my partner and clarifying a few things, it made sense to me how that all worked.
- I wasn't quite sure what fetch meant, but when you have multiple of developers who are working and committing their files, you want to use git fetch to get the most up to date work when collaborating. 
- I asked my part questions regarding to branches and new branches. He reminded of what directory I was in at all times. Bane my GPS, helped me understand fetch and explained to me why we use the collaborator feature from Github.
- I'm a bit confused sometime when to pull and merge. Mostly just the Github.
- My experience with my GPS was vey insightful. He mentioned that we did a great job, and it is okay to feel confuse at times. He made me fee comfortable throughout the process and was cordial while walking me to the steps as the driver.
